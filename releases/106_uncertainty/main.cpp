// Uncertainty — a Buchla 266 Source of Uncertainty tribute, plus a
// Buchla-lineage wavefolder, for the Music Thing Modular Workshop
// Computer.
//
// Five blocks share the card:
//   Noise source    - flat / low-biased (pink) / high-biased (blue),
//                     cycled by tapping the Z switch down. -> Audio Out 2
//   FRV             - Fluctuating Random Voltage: a random walk that
//                     glides continuously between new targets. Rate set
//                     by X (and CV In 2). Runs on the second core, since
//                     its rate can be far slower than the 48kHz audio
//                     loop. -> CV Out 1
//   QRV             - Quantized Random Voltage: a fresh random value
//                     latched on each Pulse In 1 trigger, held with no
//                     slew. Range set by Y. -> CV Out 2
//   Wavefolder      - Chris Johnson's antiderivative-antialiased fold
//                     (ported from Utility Pair), drive from Main knob +
//                     CV In 1 (bipolar). Audio In 1 -> Audio Out 1
//   Pulse alternator - Pulse In 1 is duplicated straight through to
//                     Pulse Out 1 and Pulse Out 2, alternating which
//                     output gets each successive pulse (a T-flip-flop
//                     style splitter) — independent of, and in addition
//                     to, that same Pulse In 1 also triggering QRV above.
//                     LED 5 flashes on every pulse, both outputs.
//
// There used to be a sixth block here: a fixed +-1V window comparator on
// Audio In 1, feeding the same Pulse Out 1/2 alternator. Removed outright
// rather than reworked — the alternator logic was worth keeping, the
// comparator wasn't.
//
// Switch Up gives Main/X/Y a second job each, as attenuverters for the
// section they already control: Main becomes the wavefolder's CV In 1
// attenuverter, X becomes FRV's output attenuverter, Y becomes QRV's
// output attenuverter. Each knob's two jobs share pot-pickup logic
// (dsp/dual_role_knob.h) so switching Up and back never snaps a value to
// wherever the knob physically ended up while it was doing its other
// job — see that file for the mechanism.
//
// See README.md for the full panel layout and the hardware-reality
// corrections (voltage range, switch behaviour) this build is based on.
