// Wavefolder, ported from Chris Johnson's proven "Utility Pair" wavefolder
// (https://github.com/chrisgjohnson/Utility-Pair, src/main.cpp,
// `wavefolder::fold_function` / `int_function` / `aa_wavefolder`).
//
// Two earlier attempts at this block (a hard triangle-reflection fold,
// then a smooth sine-table fold) both sounded wrong on real hardware.
// Both were the same mistake in different clothes: evaluating a
// nonlinear function fresh on every sample with no antialiasing.
// Wavefolding creates harmonics above what the signal had going in — a
// naive per-sample fold generates content above the 24kHz Nyquist limit,
// which does not disappear, it aliases: folds back down into the audible
// range as inharmonic noise. That happens whether the fold's corner is
// sharp (triangle) or smooth (sine) — a smoother corner just delays the
// problem to higher fold counts rather than removing it.
//
// The actual fix — proven on real hardware in Utility Pair, and written
// up in Demonstrations+HelloWorlds/PicoSDK/ComputerCard/NOTES.md under
// "Antiderivative antialiasing" (ADAA), after Parker et al., DAFx-16 —
// isn't a different fold shape at all. It's evaluating the fold's
// *antiderivative* F(x) = integral of fold(x), then taking the discrete
// slope (F(x) - F(prev_x)) / (x - prev_x) between this sample and the
// last one, instead of calling fold(x) directly. That discrete slope is
// mathematically the average of the continuous-time fold output across
// the interval between samples, which acts as a filter that suppresses
// exactly the above-Nyquist content a naive per-sample evaluation would
// have aliased. See NOTES.md for the full derivation; this file only
// needs the result.
//
// fold_function and int_function below are Chris Johnson's exact integer
// formulas — a fixed period-8192 triangle fold and its analytic integral.
// The only change from the original is structural: his version keeps
// `lastval`/`lastx` as function-local statics inside a class template
// (correct there because Utility Pair instantiates one wavefolder per
// channel, so the template parameter gives each channel its own static
// storage) — here there's a single instance, so they're ordinary member
// variables instead. The knob+CV combination that feeds `mult` below is
// his original formula verbatim (`mult = k + CVIn(I)`, no clamping): CV
// In 1 is bipolar and adds straight onto the knob-derived drive, so
// enough negative CV can push `mult` negative — which inverts the signal
// before folding rather than just attenuating toward silence. That's not
// a bug to guard against; it's what "bipolar" buys you here; a real
// wavefolder driven through zero behaves the same way.
