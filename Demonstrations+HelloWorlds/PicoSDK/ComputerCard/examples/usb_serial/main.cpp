/*

Output of data over a USB serial port, for e.g. debugging

This requires multicore processing, as USB is too slow to execute in ProcessSample.
Furthermore, because the RPi Pico SDK implementation of sending stdout to a USB
serial port runs code on core 0, we must run the ComputerCard ProcessSample loop on core 1.

To use, connect USB to a computer and run a serial terminal at 115200 baud
